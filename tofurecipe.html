        <h1>Good tofu recipe</h1>
        <p>Technically makes 2 servings but I tend to eat the whole lot in a big bowl</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>280g tofu (I used Tofoo because it's my faaaaave so the 280g is just the size of one pack of Tofoo but it seems to work!)</li>
            <li>1/3 - 2/3 cup* nutritional yeast</li>
            <li>2-4 dessertspoons* of olive oil</li>
            <li>2-4 dessertspoons* of soy sauce</li>
            <li>As much garlic as you can be bothered to mince</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 200F</li>
            <li>Tear the tofu up into uneven bits (which is what I do to save washing up an extra knife but like feel free to chop it I can't stop you)</li>
            <li>Put all the ingredients except tofu into a big bowl and stir it up until it makes a flavour squidge</li>
            <li>Add the tofu and stir until all the tofu is covered by the flavour squidge</li>
            <li>Put on a baking tray and stick in the oven for 15 minutes</li>
            <li>Take out and turn all the pieces over so every side of the tofu gets super crunchy</li>
            <li>Put back in the oven for 15 more minutes</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Serving suggestion: the bottom of the baking tray is probably covered in salty crunchy goodness so don't be ashamed to scrape it off and eat it, it's really good go for it</p>
        <br/>
        <p>So I used to use the lower amount of flavour ingredients for half a pack of tofu but then I didn't have much nutritional yeast left so 
            I used half the amount of flavour ingredients on a whole pack of tofu and it was still super good so go with your gut on amounts.
