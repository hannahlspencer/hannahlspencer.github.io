											<h3><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bbc.mobile.news.ww&hl=en">BBC News Apps</a></h3>
											<h5>Mar - Sep '19</h5>
											<p>I joined News apps in a period of transformation in which both the app appearance and structure was being completely scrapped and rewritten to better serve the diverse needs of its 9 million weekly users. I was able to contribute from the project's very beginning, from design sprints with the UX team, to user research, to deciding on ways to implement and test the new systems. All programming was done in Kotlin (with the exception of a few JavaScript modules to allow the app's search topics to be set by journalists in the CMS).</p>

											<h5>Sep '18 - Mar '19</h5>
											<p>My first rotation was working full stack on a user-generated content uploader with a place for moderators to view and approve or deny the content submitted. I wrote Java with Spring and Maven in the backend and JavaScript (including Node and React) in the frontend. I also worked with Jenkins and set up permissions in AWS with Python scripts. </p>

						<h4>Graduate Software Engineer</h4>
						<h5>Since Sept '18</h5>
						<p>Being part of the BBC software engineering graduate scheme has meant I've had the opportunity to be on four different teams for six months each over the course of two years. This scheme has given me experience in both a breadth of technologies and a great variety of team working practices. During this time so far I've been able to work on products that are used by millions across the world, such as the BBC News Android app, and have been given opportunities to affect these products from concept designs to implementation.</p>

									<p>Birkbeck opened up a whole new world to me. I learnt Java, became obsessed with regex, discovered databases, and fell in love with Kotlin.
